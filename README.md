# Show a MacBook Pro Retina screen manufacturer model number

The manufacturer model number will be something like this: "LP154YL01001".

The first two letters indicates the manufacturer company:

  * "LS" prefix: built by Samsung

  * "LP" prefix: built by LG

This works on a typical MacBook Pro Retina from approximately 2012.
We welcome improvements for newer MacBooks, newer OS versions, etc.

In our experience, the screens that are manufactured by LG have had many
problems with ghosting and image retention, and must be replaced by Apple.
