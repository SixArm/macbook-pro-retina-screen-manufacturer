# MacBook Pro Retina screen manufacturer model

Run this script on a MacBook Pro that has a Retina screen,
and the script shows the manufacturer model number.

Syntax:

    macbook-pro-retina-screen-manufacturer

Example:

    $ macbook-pro-retina-screen-manufacturer
    Manufacturer is LG, model is LP154YL01001

The model's first two letters indicate the manufacturer company:

  * "LP" prefix: the manufacturer is LG

  * "LS" prefix: the manufacturer is Samsung

This works on a typical MacBook Pro Retina from approximately 2012.

We welcome improvements for newer MacBooks, newer OS versions, etc.

In our experience, the screens that are manufactured by LG have had many
problems with ghosting and image retention, and must be replaced by Apple.
